    "Alternatively, students can open an account individually to develop their skills outside of the classroom!" : "",
    "Teachers can view statistics on their students like the number of messages sent and received." : "",
    "Teachers can easily open accounts for their entire classroom, allowing each student to chat via direct message with a native speaker of the foreign language that they are learning." : "",
    "Students with conversational abilities in a foreign language are connected with students who speak the language they are learning and are learning the language they speak!" : "",
    "How does it work?" : "",
    "With a Langolio account, a student is automatically connected to students who speak their target language. No hassle for teachers. Students can get real practice communicating with native speakers, and teachers can easily keep track of their students." : "",
    "Langolio solves all of these issues." : "",
    "In addition, teachers are hesitant to ask students to use texting, email, or video chat to communicate with a pen pal, since they cannot censor what their students discuss, and they are not able to monitor whether or not each student is actually engaging with his or her pen pal." : "",
    "Thousands of students go through years of foreign language classes in middle school, high school, and college without ever talking to native speakers of that foreign language. Foreign language teachers tend not to engage in pen pal programs because it is time consuming to find a class of students in a foreign country that will pair well with their own class." : "",
